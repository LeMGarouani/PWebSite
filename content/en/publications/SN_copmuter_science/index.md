# Abstract
<p style='text-align: justify;'>
The Industry 4.0 emphasizes the extensive utilization of Cyber Physical Systems (CPSs) that can be deployed across various application domains. Designing and implementing CPSs for different applications require tailored architectures encompassing physical sensors and cyber systems management, as well as ensuring seamless communication between various subsystems. However, the lack of essential knowledge among researchers and engineers poses a challenge in creating autonomous CPSs. To address this challenge, this paper introduces the concept of a novel Cyber Physical Recommendation System (IoT-AID). The proposed automated decision support framework aims to support researchers and engineers in designing and building more efficient CPSs based on specific objectives, domains, and input application scenarios. By employing a unique architecture model encompassing components, connections, and tasks of CPSs, the IoT-AID recommends the necessary components for the desired CPS. Ultimately, this proposed framework aims to facilitate the progression of leading factories towards achieving the full potential of the fourth industrial revolution.
